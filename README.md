Weather Prediction Model

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project provides a Streamlit-based web application for weather prediction using pre-trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models. Users can select models specific to Texas and New York to predict temperature outputs based on features like air temperature, rainfall, and day of the year.
